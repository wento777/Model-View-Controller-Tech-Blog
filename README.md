# Model-View-Controller-Tech-Blog



 ## Description 

- This project was designed as a homework assignment for KU coding bootcamp in Module 14 Challenge, Model-View-Controller (MVC) Challenge: Tech Blog.

-  Writing about tech can be just as important as making it.

- Because this Challenge will require the use of the Inquirer package, ensure that you install and use Inquirer version 8.2.4. To do so, use the following command in your project folder: npm i inquirer@8.2.4.

- Testing is key to making code maintainable, you’ll also write unit tests for each part of your code and ensure that it passes all of them.


- A major aspect of this challenge was the balance between figuring out which solution made sense and the solution that would be most efficient.

- Because this application won’t be deployed, i will also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality. 

- Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies.

- A simple Google search for any concept covered in this course returns thousands of think pieces and tutorials from developers of all skill levels!

 ## Installation

  - There is no starter code for this assignment.

  - In order to install inquirer, i used npm i inquirer@8.2.4.

  - The application will be deployed by using the following command: 'npm start'.



## Usage

  - This Challenge will combine many of the skills you’ve learned over the first ten weeks of this course. To help you get started, we’ve provided some guidelines in addition to the User Story and Acceptance Criteria.


  - 

  - 

  - Make sure that you remove dist from the .gitignore file so that Git will track this folder and include it when you push up to your application's repository.
  




## User Story
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data




## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list

 ## Contribute 

 -  Create a .gitignore file and include node_modules/ and .DS_Store/ so that your node_modules directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Be sure to create your .gitignore file before installing any npm dependencies.

- This Challenge will combine many of the skills you’ve learned over the first ten weeks of this course. To help you get started, we’ve provided some guidelines in addition to the User Story and Acceptance Criteria.

- Your application should use JestLinks to an external site. for running the unit tests and InquirerLinks to an external site. for collecting input from the user. The application will be invoked by using the following command:
node index.js

- Include a video of the typical user flow through your application. This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection.

- Include any other screenshots you deem necessary to help someone who has never been introduced to your application understand the purpose and function of it. This is how you will communicate to potential employers or other developers in the future what you built and why, and to show how it works.

- Refer to the Video Submission Guide Links to an external site.on the Full-Stack Blog for additional guidance on creating a video.
